# Cup Adventure!

The "Cup Adventure" program is designed to encourage students to reduce the amount of single-use cups and promote a more sustainable campus. Reusable cups would be circulated around the campus through borrowing and returning, and sustainability credits could be earned with rewards redeemable after each circulation.

The number of coffee cups thrown away in the U.S. has increased by 50 billion every year. Since it would take between 20-100 uses for a reusable cup to make up for the greenhouse gas emissions of a single-use cup, the “Cup Adventure” will help save the greenhouse gas emissions by at least 10 times a single-use cup would generate as a reusable usually take more than 1000 uses. This number is expected to boost exponentially given the amount of staffs and students on campus.

Activities when you embark on a Cup Adventure:
1. Borrow : Borrow a cup from your favorite vendor!
2. Return : Return the cup before embarking on a new adventure.
3. Save the earth: Everytime you use a reusable cup, mother earth hugs you very tight to show her thanks.
